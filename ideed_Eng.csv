YC has built programs that support founders throughout the life of their company. Many of our services were created by YC alumni who later became YC partners — so, we understand the challenges involved with building a company. We help founders navigate their biggest challenges — from learning how to start a company, to finding customers, to raising funding and hiring their first employees, to raising a Series A and scaling beyond.  About the role  Twice a year, we receive tens of thousands of applications from promising startups all around the world. Reviewing these applications is one of the most important aspects of YC’s business. The ideal candidate will be a software engineer first, data scientist second. You will be the point person for data pipeline, analysis and modeling efforts, primarily focusing on admissions data. While fundamentally a technical role, promising candidates should also be excellent communicators, proactively seek out strategic opportunities to improve processes, and be open to doing non-technical tasks like reviewing applications and interviewing startups. In this role, you will support efforts in the following domains: Build new admissions software features Conduct exploratory analysis on admissions data to inform strategic decision making. Collaborate with software engineering to maintain and extend existing data infrastructure. Build machine learning models to support admissions processes. Develop internal tools for parsing unstructured data. Understand the admissions pipeline and determine new ways to improve data collection, search and review.

An interest in startups The ideal candidate is self-motivated, independent, and passionate about using data to answer interesting questions to find promising founders and make YC the best experience for them. Strong candidates will be comfortable with handling a diverse set of tasks - from modeling the expected number of applications in a given batch to building the software that handles those applications, to actually reviewing them.  We are looking for someone senior enough to know best practices, but still excited to get their hands dirty. You should understand and know how to choose the right tool for any given data problem, even if that tool ends up being a survey or talking to users face to face. YC started as a family business, and we look for low-ego people who prioritize getting the job done over tool or title.  This is a good job for someone who is excited about startups and interested in learning more about them. You’ve likely worked at or started a startup, or want to do so in the future.

An incredible team of fun, humble but brilliant co-workers   Background  Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs, vital to igniting growth, vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future for billions around the globe.  But, innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees often have lots of ideas to improve the business, but, with no formal process, their ideas go unheard, and they eventually give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation teams are expected to support a growing list of activities but have historically lacked strong tools designed for the job. Executives, despite having millions to invest, live in fear of disruption, and still have no idea where their “next big idea” will come from, or if it will come at all.  At Brightidea, we’ve built a software platform that’s solving these problems. We’ve been helping organizations be more efficient with the 1.5 trillion dollars invested in R&D annually.  Our Company & Culture  We are a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded team of self-starters who show up every day with a singular mission: to create a world where the best ideas win. Our primary focus this year is to continue to add exceptionally talented and motivated individuals to the Brightidea team. We are ambitious, bold, highly-collaborative, focused, and we aim to win.

If you identify with being humble, T-shaped, and relentlessly resourceful then this could be the perfect team for you to shine in.  Brightidea believes that everyone has the ability to make a difference and that a diverse team generates more innovation and bigger ideas. Just as our product invites organizations to crowd source innovation across their workforce, Brightidea is inclusive and does not discriminate. We accept everybody."
